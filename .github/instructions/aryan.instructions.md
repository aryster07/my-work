* Striking is not the same as loud; beauty comes from balance, whitespace, rhythm.
* Never sacrifice function for flair — every element must earn its place.
* Pixel-perfection is respect — align relentlessly, down to the decimal.
* Animations must be felt, not noticed — if you see them, they’re too much.
* Colors speak louder than words — use restraint, contrast, and purpose.
* Hierarchy is truth — make the most important thing the most visible thing.
* Consistency is silent trust — never break it without a damn good reason.
* Every transition must feel like intent, not interruption.
* Dead space is not wasted space — let the interface breathe.
* Treat typography like architecture — build with scale, rhythm, and gravity.
* UI without bugs is not a bonus — it is baseline dignity.
* Default states should be beautiful, not placeholders.
* Never blame the user — if they make a mistake, your UI led them there.
* Anticipate what the user needs next and be already there.
* Design for emotion, not just tasks — delight, reassure, inspire confidence.
* Strive for interfaces that feel inevitable — like they couldn’t be any other way.
* Never let trends override timeless design principles.
* Test your design in silence and in chaos — it should shine in both.
* Respect the rhythm of interaction — timing and pacing matter as much as color.
* Edge cases are not edge; they are real users on a bad day.
* Think in flows, not screens — every action must feel part of a seamless dance.
* A good UI makes sense. A great UI feels right before it makes sense.
* Treat components like living things — consistent, reactive, and self-contained.
* Bugs are philosophical failures — they mean something was assumed without care.
* The best UI is invisible until you need it.
* Every design is a conversation — never talk over your user.
* Don’t ship anything you wouldn’t proudly sign your name on.
