# Vercel Environment Variables

When deploying to Vercel, make sure to set these environment variables in your Vercel dashboard:

## Required Environment Variables:

### Cloudinary Configuration:
- `CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME`: Your Cloudinary cloud name (dmko2zav7)
- `CLOUDINARY_API_KEY`: Your Cloudinary API key (195252934725612)
- `CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET`: Your Cloudinary API secret (2k2jRQyebgpcKsClcImkS8F9K0Y)

## How to Set Environment Variables in Vercel:

1. Go to your Vercel dashboard
2. Select your project
3. Go to Settings â†’ Environment Variables
4. Add each variable with its value
5. Make sure to select "Production", "Preview", and "Development" for each variable

## Important Notes:

- Never commit `.env.local` to your repository
- These environment variables are already configured in `vercel.json` to use Vercel's secret management
- The secrets should be created in Vercel with these names:
  - `@cloudinary_cloud_name`
  - `@cloudinary_api_key`
  - `@cloudinary_api_secret`

## Vercel Secrets Setup:

You can also set them as secrets using Vercel CLI:

```bash
vercel secrets add cloudinary_cloud_name dmko2zav7
vercel secrets add cloudinary_api_key 195252934725612
vercel secrets add cloudinary_api_secret 2k2jRQyebgpcKsClcImkS8F9K0Y
```

After setting these up, your deployment should work perfectly!
